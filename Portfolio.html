<div>  Hi! My name is Christine Liu and I'm a rising junior in high school. With only 2 years left in my high school career, I have become much more serious about my future.
  With my newfound interest in building a future towards college, I have been taking on different internships and opportunities that cover a large range of topics, which
  I hope will allow me to figure out what I am truly interested in. Keep scrolling to glimpse the different things that I have been doing!</p></div>
