        <p class=textbox> Computer Science is a new adventure that I have embarked on in the
          summer of 2017. I was never a tech person but in this day in age of
          rapid technological advancement, it is most crucial to have a basic
          understanding of it all. Currently, I am a participant of the Girls Who
          Code program at Adobe, NY. This program allowed me to dip my toe in the
          field of computer science. During the program I completed many
          projects(including creating this portfolio website), which are displayed in the
          picture gallary to the left.</p>

        <p class=textbox> Politics started becoming more pronounced in my life
          beginning with the 2017 presidential elections. Being a first generation
          Asian American, U.S. politics, or politics in general, was never the center
          of discussion, thus, all the information that I recieved about current events or world events
          came from school discussion or news articles. This summer I became involved
          in City Council Elections. I work as a volunteer where I learn and participate in
          the different stages of the election.
